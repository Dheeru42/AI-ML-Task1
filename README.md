## ðŸ§¾ Project Overview: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates basic data preprocessing techniques in Python for preparing datasets for machine learning or data analysis tasks.

### ðŸ“Œ Key Steps Performed

1. **Library Import**
   - Essential Python libraries like `pandas` are imported for data manipulation.

2. **Dataset Creation or Loading**
   - A sample dataset i.e Titanic is imported from an external file for demonstration.

3. **Initial Data Inspection**
   - Basic exploratory steps like viewing the first few rows, checking data types, and summarizing statistics using `.head()`, `.info()`, and `.describe()` are performed.

4. **Handling Missing Values**
   - Techniques such as identifying missing values, using `SimpleImputer` to fill in missing data based on strategy (mean or most_frequent), are applied.

5. **Data Type Conversion**
   - Converted columns from float to integer or object types based on the requirement using `astype()`.

6. **Feature Selection and Dropping Columns**
   - Irrelevant columns (e.g., index or unnamed columns) are dropped to clean the dataset for further analysis.

7. **Encoding Data using Label Encoding and Map Function**  
   - Convert Categorical values into Numerical Values.

9. **Suppressing Warnings**
   - Used code to ignore unnecessary warnings during data processing for cleaner output visibility.

10. **Remove Outliers**  
   - Filtered the DataFrame to retain only those rows where values in each column were within the IQR bounds.

11. **Compare Before and After**  
   - Compared the shape of the original and cleaned dataset to confirm the number of outliers removed.

12. **Save Cleaned Dataset**  
   - Saved the cleaned dataset to a new file using `df.to_csv()` for further analysis.
